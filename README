fsmtime			21.01.2012	Finite State Machine - using library http://wiring.uniandes.edu.co/source/trunk/wiring/firmware/libraries/FSM/
							Implements a simple state table with 2 timed states and 2 states dividing the rest of the CPU time
							In DEBUG mode: Calculates the number of passes and displays these frequencies by printing to Serial
